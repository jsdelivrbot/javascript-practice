# React practice for App Academy

Hi there, so it's pretty critical that you get started with React before hitting the bootcamp scene. 

Why? Because React is complicated!

The first thing you should do to get started is head over to the [React Docs] [react-docs]

[react-docs]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html
[hello-world]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html
[introducing-jsx]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html
[rendering-elements]:  https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html
[components-props]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html
[state-lifecyce]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html

Read [Hello World] [hello-world] and [Introducing JSX] [introducing-jsx] and the first paragraph of [Rendering Elements] [rendering-elements]

- Try to create a React App in codepen that is a text-based ticking clock, This App should not use state. if you need a hint you can read past the first paragraph of [Rendering Elements] [rendering-elements]

Read [Components and Props] [components-props] and [State and Lifecycle] [state-lifecycle]

- Create the text-based ticking clock using a class-based component with state.
